# Average Math Score by Gender – Visualization Project
This repository contains a simple data visualization project that demonstrates how to use Python (with Seaborn and Matplotlib) to plot the average math scores of students based on gender.

# Project Description
The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize the difference in average math scores between male and female students. The visualization helps in understanding gender-based performance trends using bar plots.

# Output

Below is the final output of the analysis:
X-axis: Gender (male, female)
Y-axis: Average Math Score
Error bars: Represent standard error of the mean

# Tools Used

Python 3.x
Pandas
Seaborn
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook
